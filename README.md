<h4> This a Deep Learning model for detecting whether the person has wear face mask properly or not. We have used 2 different models <br> </h4>
 1. Tensorflow Object Detection with Pretrained SSD Resnet Model <br>
 2. Yolo V5s <br>
 Data Annotation has been done using MakeSense.AI https://www.makesense.ai/ <br>
 For above two models annotation format is .xml and .txt respectively. <br>
